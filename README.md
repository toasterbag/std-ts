# Typescript Standard Library

Extensions to native types that should, in my opinion, be included natively. In the future if we get a pipeline operator then this may prove redundant.

## Warning

Extedning native objects is not good practise but very useful for personal projects or scripts where ergonomics is important. These implementations may not be the most efficient but they work!
